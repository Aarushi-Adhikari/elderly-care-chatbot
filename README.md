# elderly-care-chatbot
This is a chatbot for elderly people

Project aim: 
Project Levina aims to create a chatbot to befriend lonely elderly people. 
It is inspired by my Christmas volunteering at a care home last year, where I saw heartbreaking loneliness. 
I designed the chatbot to provide companionship and support, offering a caring friend always by their side.

Improvements:
- Validation to be implemented (length validation, sensitive words)
- Mood selection can be improved with more prompt engineering
